    <u><h4>Abstract</h4></u>
    <p>
        The research shows what difficulties are faced by farmers in Bangladesh and what can be done to overcome 
        them with the help of technology. We have analyzed many research papers where many of the papers focused 
        on the humidity and weather conditions of a particular area. Moreover, they focused on water efficiency 
        with the help of IoT. Our research proposes how farmers can detect plant diseases, provide fertilizer to 
        the plants, and check the weather with the help of IoT such as Weather Stations, Field Sensors, Equipment 
        tools and Visual Capturing. This will eventually help farmers to get higher profits.
